# Comic-Archiver
A (template for a) program for saving a local copy of a webcomic from the net (Essentially a web scraper)
Since most websites are different, each site will need some code tweeking to save properly
(Will mark those sections of code with #UserTweek)
Most of the recoding will be in the 'parser' functions, or just under the __main__ declaration

Notes:
This program is old (PythonV2 old), and been through many revisions. But it works well enough to keep using it.

Running:
running the main program will autogenerate the "Debug.log" and a "saved" folder to store the targets

BUG:
-urllib.request.urlopen() can hang, causing program to hang
