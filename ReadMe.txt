# Comic-Archiver
A (template for a) program for saving a local copy of a webcomic from the net (Essentially a web scraper)
Since most websites are different, each site will need some code tweeking to save properly
(Will mark those sections of code with #UserTweek)
Most of the recoding will be in the __main__ declaration
// This program is old (since Python2 old), and been through many revisions. But it works well enough to keep using it.

Running:
running the main program will autogenerate the "ComicArchiver.log" and a "saved" folder to store the targets
