# Comic-Archiver
A (template for a) program for saving a local copy of a webcomic from the net (Essentially a web scraper)
Since most websites are different, each site will need some code tweeking to save properly (see getting started)
Most of the recoding will be under the __main__ declaration
//This program is old (since Python2 old), and has been through many revisions. But it works well enough to keep using it.

Getting Started:
This program is designed to go through a series of webpages in sequence, and save a particular image from each webpage (saved in the 'saved' folder)

Running the main program "ComicArchiver.py" will autogenerate the "ComicArchiver.log" and a "saved" folder to store the targets
